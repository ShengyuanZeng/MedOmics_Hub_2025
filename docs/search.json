    "text": "Cell proliferation is a fundamental biological process that drives exponential increases in cell numbers and facilitates rapid tissue growth through coordinated cell growth and division. In unicellular organisms, like yeast cells, the cellular proliferation is primarily regulated by nutrient availability. Cells tend to grow faster and become larger in nutrient-rich environments compared to nutrient-limited conditions. This adaptive strategy allows cells to tailor their growth and proliferation in response to environmental cues. In multicellular organisms, however, cellular proliferation is not solely dictated by nutrient availability; instead, it is tightly regulated by complex extracellular signaling networks that coordinate growth with tissue architecture, organ function, and overall organismal development (Grewal & Edgar, 2003) (Conlon & Raff, 2003). Cellular quiescence represents the counterpart to cell proliferation. In this reversible state, cells exit the proliferative cycle and enter a non-dividing phase while retaining the ability to re-enter the cell cycle when conditions become favorable. Unlike other non-dividing states, such as senescence or terminal differentiation‚Äîwhich involve permanent cell cycle arrest‚Äîquiescence is a transient state (Marescal & Cheeseman, 2020)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Target Identification and Drug Development\nSince 2000, oncology drug approvals by the FDA have increased significantly, driven by the rise of targeted therapies and novel treatment approaches. Kinase inhibitors remain the most approved class, while immune checkpoint inhibitors, introduced in 2011, have rapidly become the second most approved category.\n\n\n\nTrends in Oncology Therapeutic Approvals. Data adapted from Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2023, PMID: 37344568).\n\n\nIt is well established that many, if not most, cancer drugs exhibit off-target or multi-mechanism effects due to their multi-target interaction characteristics, some of which are not their primary intended targets.\nThese multi-/off-target effects can directly contribute to low clinical trial success rates, high off-target toxicity, post-approval withdrawals, and weak confirmation of survival benefit; thus, investing in robust and specific target identification, coupled with biomarker selection, can dramatically increase efficacy, achieve true precision medicine, reduce adverse effects, and improve overall success in anti-cancer drug development.\n\n\n\nDistribution of Numbers of (Off-)targets per Drug in Each Class of Cancer Drugs. J Chem Inf Model (2019, PMID: 31025863).\n\n\nThermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) and Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) are mass spectrometry‚Äìbased proteomics techniques designed to study protein stability and interactions in a cellular context. Both methods leverage the principle that small molecule binding often alters the thermal stability or solubility profile of a protein.\nIn TPP, cells or lysates are exposed to a temperature gradient in the presence or absence of a compound, allowing for the detection of protein stability shifts across the proteome. PISA simplifies this approach by measuring protein solubility changes at a single elevated temperature, enabling higher throughput while maintaining sensitivity.\n\n\n\nThermal Shift Assay Principle Science Design (BioRender)\n\n\nThese methods provide unbiased, proteome-wide insights into drug‚Äìprotein interactions under near-physiological conditions, without requiring chemical modification of compounds. TPP and PISA are valuable tools for target validation, mechanism-of-action studies, and off-target identification. By revealing functional proteoform responses, they support biomarker discovery and contribute to more precise, effective cancer therapies aligned with individual patient biology.\n\n\nHow to make a PISA\n\n1. Drug Treatment\nCells (or lysates) are treated with the compound of interest (and control) to assess target engagement.\n\n\n2. Thermal Treatment\nSamples are subjected to a temperature gradient to induce thermal denaturation.\nDrug binding typically stabilizes target proteins, shifting their thermal solubility profile.\n\n\n3. Centrifugation\nHeated samples are centrifuged to separate soluble (stable) proteins from aggregated (denatured) proteins.\nOnly the soluble fractions are used for downstream proteomic analysis.\n\n\n4. Protein Digestion\nSoluble proteins are enzymatically digested (e.g., with trypsin) into peptides suitable for MS analysis.\n\n\n5. Mass Spectrometry (MS) Analysis\nPeptides are analyzed using LC-MS/MS to generate high-resolution proteomic data.\n\n\n6. Database Search with MS Engines\nRaw MS data are searched against protein databases using search engines (e.g., MaxQuant or Proteome Discoverer).\n\n\n7. Statistical Analysis (DEqMS)\nQuantitative protein data are processed with DEqMS to identify proteins with significant abundance changes.\n\n\n\nOverview of the PISA Assay Workflow (Clinical Proteomics MS Core Facility)(BioRender)\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization with VolcanoPISA\nData are visualized using the volcanoPISA Shiny app, generating volcano plots to highlight stabilized proteins and destabilized proteins (potential target/off-targets or effectors).\n\n\n\nvolcanoPISA"
