    "text": "Since 2000, oncology drug approvals by the FDA have increased significantly, driven by the rise of targeted therapies and novel treatment approaches. Kinase inhibitors remain the most approved class, while immune checkpoint inhibitors, introduced in 2011, have rapidly become the second most approved category.\n\n\n\nTrends in Oncology Therapeutic Approvals. Data adapted from Nature Reviews Drug Discovery (2023, PMID: 37344568).\n\n\nIt is well established that many, if not most, cancer drugs exhibit off-target or multi-mechanism effects due to their multi-target interaction characteristics, some of which are not their primary intended targets.\nThese multi-/off-target effects can directly contribute to low clinical trial success rates, high off-target toxicity, post-approval withdrawals, and weak confirmation of survival benefit; thus, investing in robust and specific target identification, coupled with biomarker selection, can dramatically increase efficacy, achieve true precision medicine, reduce adverse effects, and improve overall success in anti-cancer drug development.\n\n\n\nDistribution of Numbers of (Off-)targets per Drug in Each Class of Cancer Drugs. J Chem Inf Model (2019, PMID: 31025863).\n\n\nThermal Proteome Profiling (TPP) and Proteome Integral Solubility Alteration (PISA) are mass spectrometry–based proteomics techniques designed to study protein stability and interactions in a cellular context. Both methods leverage the principle that small molecule binding often alters the thermal stability or solubility profile of a protein.\nIn TPP, cells or lysates are exposed to a temperature gradient in the presence or absence of a compound, allowing for the detection of protein stability shifts across the proteome. PISA simplifies this approach by measuring protein solubility changes at a single elevated temperature, enabling higher throughput while maintaining sensitivity.\n\n\n\nThermal Shift Assay Principle Science Design (BioRender)\n\n\nThese methods provide unbiased, proteome-wide insights into drug–protein interactions under near-physiological conditions, without requiring chemical modification of compounds. TPP and PISA are valuable tools for target validation, mechanism-of-action studies, and off-target identification. By revealing functional proteoform responses, they support biomarker discovery and contribute to more precise, effective cancer therapies aligned with individual patient biology.\n\n\n\nvolcanoPISA"
